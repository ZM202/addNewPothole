    <!--1. Create a 3-page website (Homepage, Add new pothole, Map page).
        2. Create a navbar with three buttons.
        The "Home" button should be in upper left, 
        and "Add new" and "Map" should be on the upper right.-->

    separate them out? I separate out the diff so they aren't lininig in the same line.I tried to
    play around w/margin but I don't think it is lining up straight for the links.-->
